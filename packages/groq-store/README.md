# @sanity/groq-store

> **Warning**
>
> Don't use this package directly, yet.
> It's a new version of [`@sanity/groq-store`](https://github.com/sanity-io/groq-store) that uses Content Source Maps instead of groq-js to subscribe to queries that are kept in sync with document mutations in real time.
> It's currently used by `@sanity/presentation`.
> We're planning on using it in `@sanity/core-loader` and `@sanity/preview-kit`.
> When the API is stable we'll document it and https://github.com/sanity-io/groq-store will be archived and link to this README.
> This notice will be removed and you may use it directly to build experiences that require real time content with extremely low latency.
