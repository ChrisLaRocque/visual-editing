# Next.js&mdash;Minimal starter

> ℹ️ Note:  
>    This is a minimal documentation set to get you started with Next.js.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Run the developement server

First, run the development server:

```bash
# Run with npm
npm run dev

# Run with pnpm
pnpm dev

# Run with yarn
yarn dev
```

To check that the server is running, open [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Edit the page

To edit the page, open `app/page.tsx` in your favorite IDE, and modify it.  
The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

The project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter), a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

For more information, see the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment).
